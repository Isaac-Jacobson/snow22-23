Naming convention for original images and cropped flake images

For initial images:
	Information that needs to be included in original image names:
	- Image # (6 digits with leading zeros)
	- Date(DD-MM-YY) and time?(Maybe we don't need time)
	- Camera #

	Ex:
		(Image#)_(Cam#)_(Date(DD-MM-YY)).png
		000713_Cam4_11-08-22.png
	Similar to old convention but removes the "Flake", shortens the date, removes the time

For cropped flakes:
	Information that needs to be included:
	- Original image #
	- Flake # (Padding not needed)
	- Camera #
	- I don't think we need date or time
	- May need locational information of where the flake is was in original image (XXX-YYY of center of flake)

	Ex:
		(Image#)_(Cam#)_(Flake#)_(XXX-YYY).png
		000712_Cam4_Flake1_150-735.png
